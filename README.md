# Java_coding_tasks (Weekly)

Create your own branch with your name. 

Each java file should be followed by your name or initials in order to avoid conflicts.

Write your solutions, commit, push to your origin branch and create a pull request (from your branch --> master branch)

Assign anyone you would like.

Any suggestion for modifications are more than welcome~
