# Java_coding_tasks (Weekly)

Create your own branch with your name. 

Each java file should be followed by your name in order to avoid conflicts.

Format:   "TaskName_YourName" 

Write your solutions, commit, push to your origin branch and create a pull request (from your branch --> master branch)

Assign anyone you would like.

Any suggestion for modifications are more than welcome~
