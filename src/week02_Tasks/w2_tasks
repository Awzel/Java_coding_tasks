Week 2 Java Coding Tasks

1. Numbers -- Swap Numbers

  - Swap two variable values without using a third variable


2. Numbers -- Divisible by 3, 5, 15
Write a program that can print the numbers between 1 ~ 100 that can be divisible by 3, 5, 15.
  If the number can be divisible by 3, 5, and 15, then it should only be displayed in the DivisibleBy15 section.
  If the number can be divisible by 3 but can't be divisible by 15, then it should only be displayed in the DivisibleBy3 section.
  If the number can be divisible by 5 but can't be divisible by 15, then it should only be displayed in the DivisibleBy5 section.


3. Numbers -- print consecutive numbers
Write a function that:
Given a positive integer N, prints the consecutive numbers from 1 to N, each on a separate line. However, any number divisible
by 2, 3, or 5 should be replaced by the words Codility, Test, or Coders, respectively. If a number is divisible by more than one
of the numbers: 2, 3, or 5, then it should be replaced by a concatenation of the respective words Codility, Test, and Coders in the given order.
For example, numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 should be replaced by CodilityTest, and numbers divisible by all three numbers 2, 3, and 5, should be
replaced by CodilityTestCoders.
