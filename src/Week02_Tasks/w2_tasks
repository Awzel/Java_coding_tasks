1. Numbers -- Swap Numbers

  - Swap two variable' values without using a third variable

2. Numbers -- Divisible by 3, 5, 15
Write a program that can print the numbers between 1 ~ 100 that can be
divisible by 3, 5, 15.
if the number can be divisible by 3, 5, and 15, then it should only be displayed in DivisibleBy15 section
if the number can be divisible by 3, but cannote be divisible by 15, then it should only be displayed in DivisibleBy3 section
if the number can be divisible by 5, but cannote be divisible by 15, then it should only be displayed in DivisibleBy5 section



3. Numbers -- print consecutive numbers
Write a function:
that, given a positive integer n, print the consecutive numbers between 1 ~ n, each on a new line. However, any number divisible by 2, 3, or 5 should be replaced by the word Codility, Test, or Coders, respectively. If a number is divisible by more than one of the numbers: 2, 3, or 5, it should be replaced by the word Codility, Test, or Coders, respectively in this given order. For example, numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 should be replaced by CodilityTest and numbers divisible by both 2 and 5 should be replaced by CodilityCoders. Numbers divisible by 2, 3, and 5 should be replaced by CodilityTestCoders.2 task pdf would not let me copy paste the requirements, please add them above if anyone can.
